# python-notes-handler
Notes Handler is a program that on execution helps the user keep track of his/her notes over time. It facilitates basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations of persistent storage on notes. Apart from these basic operations, users can also perform complex tasks such as restoring notes from the previous session, getting completion statistics on created notes, to list a few. The program is user friendly with its elaborative menu system. It tries its best to guide the user at every step as to what has been done and what must be done, hence is an easy-to-use tool for a new user.
